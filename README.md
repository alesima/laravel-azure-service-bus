> Integrate **Azure Service Bus** as a queue driver and Pub/Sub module in Laravel, now with support for multiple topics.

This package provides a **custom queue driver** for Laravel that integrates with **Azure Service Bus** and adds support for **Topics and Subscriptions (Pub/Sub)**, enabling both queue-based and publish/subscribe messaging models with the ability to manage multiple topics dynamically.

---

## Features üéØ

- **Azure Service Bus Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Azure's messaging capabilities into your Laravel application.
- **Support for Laravel 5.x - 8.x**: Compatible with older Laravel versions and PHP 7.x.
- **Queue Operations**: Push, pop, and manage jobs in Azure Service Bus queues with ease.
- **Pub/Sub Module**: Publish messages to multiple topics and subscribe to them using Azure Service Bus topics and subscriptions.
- **Job Scheduling**: Supports delayed jobs using `later()` with multiple formats (e.g., `DateTime`, `DateInterval`, `int`).
- **Built with Laravel's Queuing System**: Follows the same conventions, making it easy to work with.

```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### **Queue Operations**

#### Push Jobs onto the Queue ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

You can push jobs to Azure Service Bus using the standard Laravel syntax:

```php
use App\Jobs\MyJob;

dispatch(new MyJob($data)); // Push to the default queue
```

#### Use `later()` for Delayed Jobs ‚è≥

You can schedule jobs to be pushed after a delay using various formats:

```php
dispatch((new MyJob($data))->delay(60)); // Delay by 60 seconds

$interval = new \DateInterval('PT10M'); // 10 minutes
dispatch((new MyJob($data))->delay($interval));

$releaseTime = new \DateTime('+1 hour');
dispatch((new MyJob($data))->delay($releaseTime));
```

#### Handle Jobs üöÄ

When a job is received from the queue, it will be processed as a standard Laravel job:

```php
public function handle()
{
    // Your job logic here
}
```

---

### **Pub/Sub Module**

The Pub/Sub module enables publishing messages to Azure Service Bus topics and receiving them from subscriptions. This now supports managing multiple topics dynamically.

#### Publish Messages to a Topic üì¢

You can publish a message to a specific topic:

```php
use LaravelAzureServiceBus\Services\AzurePubSubService;

$pubSub = app(AzurePubSubService::class);

// Publish to a specific topic
$pubSub->publishMessage('topic1', [
    'event' => 'user.created',
    'data' => ['user_id' => 123],
]);
```

#### Subscribe to a Specific Topic üîî

To retrieve messages from a subscription under a specific topic:

```php
use LaravelAzureServiceBus\Services\AzurePubSubService;

$pubSub = app(AzurePubSubService::class);

// Subscribe to messages from 'topic1'
$messages = $pubSub->retrieveMessages('topic1', 'subscription1');

foreach ($messages as $message) {
    echo $message; // Process the message
}
```

#### Retrieve Messages from Multiple Topics üîÑ

To work with multiple topics dynamically:

```php
use LaravelAzureServiceBus\Services\AzurePubSubService;

$pubSub = app(AzurePubSubService::class);

// Retrieve messages from multiple topics
$topics = ['topic1', 'topic2', 'topic3'];

foreach ($topics as $topic) {
    $messages = $pubSub->retrieveMessages($topic, 'subscription1');
    foreach ($messages as $message) {
        echo "From {$topic}: " . $message;
    }
}
```

---

## Configuration for Multiple Topics üõ†Ô∏è

Set the `AZURE_SERVICE_BUS_TOPICS` environment variable as a comma-separated list of topics. You can retrieve and process these dynamically in your application.

Example:

```env
AZURE_SERVICE_BUS_TOPICS=topic1,topic2,topic3
```
